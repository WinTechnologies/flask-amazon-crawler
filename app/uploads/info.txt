Description: Please build a MYSQL database and start a web service( You can use FLASk or whatever you are good at) in the environment we set for you this week.
The web service is a single page. There is one button for uploading the txt file. The successfully crawled information is saved in the mysql database. There is another search column and button. We can input sql search statement and get result below.

Requirement:
1.Design the database and table for easy search.
2.Minimize the web service, focus on the key function: input and Search.( no need for login function,etc)
3.Note: We may need to scrap information for one asin for times and have a comparative study about the information of the asins. Thus please use your creativity to design the website page based on the basic information and we want to see the comparative information based on every Scrap Date; Please also find a way about how to describe the status that the information about some asin cannot be crawled.
